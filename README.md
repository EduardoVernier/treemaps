# treemaps

This repository hosts the resources used in the paper *Quantitative Comparison of 
Dynamic Treemaps for Software Evolution Visualization*, submited to VISSOFT 2018.

The folder `Code` hosts the implementations of the treemapping algorithms. Inside it
you can find a README that explains the complation and execution of the programs.

`Datasets` holds the 28 datasets of software development origin that were used for
the evaluation of the treemapping techniques. More information about the datasets 
can be found in the paper.

Videos of the executions can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy5Y4CMtJ7mJZ29-mKHxHzirsnNZmasT5

Lastly, `Figures` holds all the visualizations generated for all datasets. This includes
all the figures that couldn't make it into the paper for lack of space. `README.pdf` explains
the design choices of the plots. `Figures/Code` includes the code that generated the
visualizations and inside it there is another README that explains how to run the 
vis pipeline.
